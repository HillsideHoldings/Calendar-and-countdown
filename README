Chrome extension for showing full year calendar, as well as for counting down to events.

To build: Just use Grunt. 

If updating the popup library, remember to check the code for any eval() functions, as these need to be removed in order to make it work as a chrome extension.

First install npm, then run (in the root directory of the checked out git repository)

npm install

Then simply run 

grunt

to build the extension.

Note that this is necessary for it to run - there is no way for it to run directly from source, as the files are not in the correct positions before everything is built with Grunt.
